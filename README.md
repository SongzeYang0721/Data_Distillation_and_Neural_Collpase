# Data distillation and Neural Collapse

This code aims at drawing a connenction between data distillation and neural collpase. The main papers consider here are:

Data distillation

- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.00050.pdf

Neural collpase
- https://github.com/tding1/Neural-Collapse

## Introduction
The idea of distillation plays a important role in these situations by reducing the resources required for the model to be effective. Can neural collpase play a role in the data distillation? We invetigate the connect here.
